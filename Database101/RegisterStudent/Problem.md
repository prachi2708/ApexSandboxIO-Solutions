The method registerStudent takes as input strings name, phone and email, and returns a string. Implement the method to insert an apxio__Student__c record with the Name, apxio__Phone__c and apxio__Email__c fields filled out, and return the autogenerated apxio__Registration_Number__c of the new record.


You will be working with the following custom object and field names for this problem:

apxio__Student__c
apxio__Student__c.apxio__Email__c
apxio__Student__c.apxio__Phone__c
apxio__Student__c.apxio__Registration_Number__c
When records are inserted, the Id is available immediately available on the record, but other fields that were changed or populated as a result of the insert are not.

Query the apxio__Student__c record after it has been inserted to obtain the registration number

**Important**

When records are inserted, the `Id` is available immediately available on the record, but other fields that were changed or populated as a result of the insert are not.

We have to query the apxio__Student__c record after it has been inserted to obtain the registration number.
