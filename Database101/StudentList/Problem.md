The method insertStudents takes as input two lists of strings studentNames and studentEmails. The two lists will always have the same size, with studentNames[i] and studentEmails[i] (for any in-range value of i) representing a student's name and email.

Write an implementation of the method that creates apxio__Student__c records for each entry in the lists with the Name and apxio__Email__c fields filled out.

You will be working with the following custom object and field names for this problem:

apxio__Student__c
apxio__Student__c.apxio__Email__c
