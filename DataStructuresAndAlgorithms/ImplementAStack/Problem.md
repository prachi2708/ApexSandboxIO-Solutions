The stack is one of the simplest data structures and almost one of the most important in programing. We use a stack to organize objects with the Last In - First Out (LIFO) principle. A user may add to the stack at any time, but may only have access to the object that was last inserted into the stack.

In this challenge you will implement a stack data structure with the following methods.

Push : add an object to the top of the stack
Pop: remove the object at the top of the stack
Peek: return the object at the top of the stack but do not remove
Size: return the number of objects in the stack
Is Empty: return true is the stack is empty, false if not
Example
stack.push(1), stack.push(2), stack.push(3) stack.push(4) ,
stack.isEmpty() //false stack.size() // 4 stack.peek() // 4 stack.pop() // 4 stack.pop() // 3 stack.size() // 2 stack.peek() // 2 stack.pop() // 2 stack.pop() // 1 stack.size() // 0 stack.isEmpty() // true stack.pop() // null
