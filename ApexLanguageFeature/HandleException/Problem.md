Implement the method divide which takes two integers a and b as input, divides a by b using the / operator, and returns the result. If any exception occurs, the method should return the exception message.

Example:

Given the following test code:
String result = divide(10,0);
result should be 'Divide by 0';

Given the following test code:
String result = divide(100, 18);
result should be '5';. The result of integer division 100/19 is 5 with a remainder of 10.


**Concept Tested:**
- Use of try/catch block.
