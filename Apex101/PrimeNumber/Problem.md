A prime number is a number greater than 1 that is not evenly divisible by any number greater than one and smaller than itself. For example, 13 is a prime number because it is not evenly divisible by any number between 1 and 13.

Implement the function isPrime that takes as input an integer greater than 1, returns true if the integer is a prime number, and returns false otherwise. Assume that the input will always be greater than 1.

isPrime(10) = false. 10 is not a prime number because it is evenly divisible by 2 and 5.

isPrime(23) = true. 23 is a prime number because it is not evenly divisible by any number from 2 to 22.
