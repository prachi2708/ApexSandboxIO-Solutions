Find the last occurrence of Integer target in a list of integers nums and return its index. If the target is not found, return -1

For instance, in the list of integers {4, 6, 1, 9, 7, 9, 2}, the function would return index 0 for the target 4, index 5 for target 9 (occurs twice), and -1 for target 3 (not found).

Example:

Given nums = new List{5, 2, 8, -4, 8, 1, 11};
findLast(nums, 12) => -1
findLast(nums, 8) => 4
findLast(nums, 11) => 6
findLast(nums, -4) => 3

**Concept Tested:**
- In this problem, we have to retun index not the element at particular index.
