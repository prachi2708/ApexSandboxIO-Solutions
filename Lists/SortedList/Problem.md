A list is considered to be sorted ascending when no element in the list is smaller than the preceding element if one is present. Similarly, a list is considered sorted descending if no element in the list is larger than the preceding element if any.

Implement the method isSorted that takes as input a list of integers numbers, returns true if the list is sorted in any direction (acsending or descending), and returns false otherwise.

Example: isSorted(new List<Integer> {5, 2, 0, -1}) evaluates to true because the input list is sorted descending.
