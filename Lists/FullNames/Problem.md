Implement the method fullNames that takes as input two equal-sized lists of strings firstNames and lastNames, and returns a new list containing full names, with each full name generated by the concatenating the first name and last name at the corresponding location in the input lists.

Example: 

Given the following test code:


List<String> firstNames = new List<String> { 'John', 'Jane' };
List<String> lastNames = new List<String> { 'Doe', 'Smith' };
List<String> result = fullNames(firstNames, lastNames);

The expressions result[0] == 'John Doe', result[1] == 'Jane Smith', and result.size() == 2 should be true. In addition, the two input arrays should be unmodified.
